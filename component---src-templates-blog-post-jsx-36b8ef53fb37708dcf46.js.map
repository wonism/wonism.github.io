It\n\t     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n\t     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n\t     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n\t     * thought.\n\t     *\n\t     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n\t     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n\t     * following ways.\n\t     *\n\t     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n\t     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n\t     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n\t     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n\t     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n\t     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n\t     * be left uncaught.\n\t     *\n\t     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n\t     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n\t     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n\t     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n\t     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n\t     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n\t     *\n\t     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n\t     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n\t     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n\t     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n\t     *\n\t     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n\t     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n\t     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n\t     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>\n\t     * const sumObserver = {\n\t     *   sum: 0,\n\t     *   next(value) {\n\t     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n\t     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n\t     *   },\n\t     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,\n\t     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n\t     *   complete() {\n\t     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n\t     *   }\n\t     * };\n\t     *\n\t     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n\t     * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n\t     *\n\t     * // Logs:\n\t     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n\t     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n\t     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n\t     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>\n\t     * let sum = 0;\n\t     *\n\t     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n\t     * .subscribe(\n\t     *   function(value) {\n\t     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n\t     *     sum = sum + value;\n\t     *   },\n\t     *   undefined,\n\t     *   function() {\n\t     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n\t     *   }\n\t     * );\n\t     *\n\t     * // Logs:\n\t     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n\t     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n\t     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n\t     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>\n\t     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n\t     *   num => console.log(num),\n\t     *   undefined,\n\t     *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n\t     * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * setTimeout(() => {\n\t     *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n\t     *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n\t     * }, 2500);\n\t     *\n\t     * // Logs:\n\t     * // 0 after 1s\n\t     * // 1 after 2s\n\t     * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n\t     *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n\t     *  Observable.\n\t     * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

That function\n\t     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n\t     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n\t     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n\t     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n\t     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n\t     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n\t     * if there is only one.\n\t     *\n\t     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n\t     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n\t     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n\t     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n\t     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n\t     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n\t     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n\t     *\n\t     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n\t     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n\t     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n\t     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n\t     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n\t     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n\t     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n\t     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n\t     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n\t     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n\t     *\n\t     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n\t     * to the same context that output function has at call time.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n\t     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n\t     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n\t     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n\t     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n\t     * something went wrong.\n\t     *\n\t     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n\t     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n\t     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n\t     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n\t     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n\t     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n\t     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n\t     *\n\t     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n\t     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n\t     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n\t     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n\t     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n\t     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n\t     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n\t     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n\t     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n\t     * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n\t     *\n\t     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n\t     * of returned function, when it is called.\n\t     *\n\t     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n\t     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n\t     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n\t     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n\t     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n\t     * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n\t     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n\t     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n\t     *\n\t     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n\t     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n\t     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n\t     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n\t     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n\t     * with that value.

If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,\n\t     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.\n\t     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event\n\t     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type\n\t     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.\n\t     *\n\t     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered\n\t     * to event target on given event type.

When\n\t     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n\t     * as third parameter as well.\n\t     *\n\t     * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n\t     *\n\t     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n\t     *\n\t     * **JQuery-style event target**\n\t     *\n\t     * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n\t     *\n\t     * **DOM NodeList**\n\t     *\n\t     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n\t     *\n\t     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n\t     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them.

So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n\t * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n\t * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n\t * on the first place and so on).\n\t *\n\t * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n\t * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n\t * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n\t * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n\t * completes immediately.\n\t *\n\t * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n\t * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n\t * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n\t * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n\t * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n\t * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n\t * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n\t * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n\t * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n\t * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n\t * value.\n\t *\n\t * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n\t * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n\t * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n\t * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n\t * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n\t * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n\t * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n\t *\n\t * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n\t * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n\t * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n\t * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n\t * of values, but values themselves.

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n\t * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n\t * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n\t * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n\t * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n\t * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n\t * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n\t *\n\t * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n\t * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n\t * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n\t * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n\t * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n\t * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n\t * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n\t *\n\t * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n\t * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n\t * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n\t * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n\t * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n\t * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n\t * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n\t * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n\t * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n\t *\n\t * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n\t * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject\n\t * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use\n\t * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},\n\t * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},\n\t * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually\n\t * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.\n\t *\n\t * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,\n\t * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>\n\t * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n\t * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());\n\t *\n\t * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));\n\t * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));\n\t *\n\t * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.\n\t *\n\t * connectableSeconds.connect();\n\t *\n\t * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,\n\t * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,\n\t * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>\n\t * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n\t *\n\t * seconds\n\t *     .multicast(\n\t *         () => new Subject(),\n\t *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.\n\t *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,\n\t *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.\n\t *     .subscribe();\n\t *\n\t * @see {@link publish}\n\t * @see {@link publishLast}\n\t * @see {@link publishBehavior}\n\t * @see {@link publishReplay}\n\t * @see {@link share}\n\t * @see {@link shareReplay}\n\t *\n\t * @param {Function|Subject} subjectOrSubjectFactory - Factory function to create an intermediate Subject through\n\t * which the source sequence's elements will be multicast to the selector function input Observable or\n\t * ConnectableObservable returned by the operator.\n\t * @param {Function} [selector] - Optional selector function that can use the input stream\n\t * as many times as needed, without causing multiple subscriptions to the source stream.\n\t * Subscribers to the input source will receive all notifications of the source from the\n\t * time of the subscription forward.\n\t * @return {Observable<T>|ConnectableObservable<T>} An Observable that emits the results of invoking the selector\n\t * on the source stream or a special {@link ConnectableObservable}, if selector was not provided.\n\t *\n\t * @method multicast\n\t * @owner Observable\n\t */\n\tfunction multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector) {\n\t    return multicast_1.multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector)(this);\n\t}\n\texports.multicast = multicast;\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=multicast.js.map\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"./node_modules/rxjs/operator/observeOn.js\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar observeOn_1 = __webpack_require__(\"./node_modules/rxjs/operators/observeOn.js\");\n\t/**\n\t *\n\t * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.\n\t *\n\t * <span class=\"informal\">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>\n\t *\n\t * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule\n\t * notifications emitted by the source Observable.

In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used.

If `func` function\n     * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n     * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting\n     * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.\n     *\n     * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called\n     * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output\n     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n     *\n     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\n     *\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n     * something went wrong.\n     *\n     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n     *\n     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n     *\n     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n     * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n     *\n     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n     * of returned function, when it is called.\n     *\n     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n     * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n     *\n     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n     *\n     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n     * import * as fs from 'fs';\n     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>\n     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n     *   console.log(err); // null\n     *   console.log(a); // 5\n     *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n     * });\n     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n     * boundSomeFunction()\n     * .subscribe(value => {\n     *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n     * });\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Use with selector function</caption>\n     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n     *   console.log(err); // undefined\n     *   console.log(a); // \"abc\"\n     *   console.log(b); // \"DEF\"\n     * });\n     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction, (a, b) => a + b);\n     * boundSomeFunction()\n     * .subscribe(value => {\n     *   console.log(value); // \"abcDEF\"\n     * });\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback in regular style</caption>\n     * someFunction(a => {\n     *   console.log(a); // 5\n     * });\n     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n     * boundSomeFunction()\n     * .subscribe(\n     *   value => {}             // never gets called\n     *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n     *);\n     *\n     *\n     * @see {@link bindCallback}\n     * @see {@link from}\n     * @see {@link fromPromise}\n     *\n     * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n     * @param {function} [selector] A function which takes the arguments from the\n     * callback and maps those to a value to emit on the output Observable.\n     * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n     * callbacks.\n     * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n     * Observable that delivers the same values the Node.js callback would\n     * deliver.\n     * @static true\n     * @name bindNodeCallback\n     * @owner Observable\n     */\n    BoundNodeCallbackObservable.create = function (func, selector, scheduler) {\n        if (selector === void 0) { selector = undefined; }\n        return function () {\n            var args = [];\n            for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n                args[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n            }\n            return new BoundNodeCallbackObservable(func, selector, args, this, scheduler);\n        };\n    };\n    BoundNodeCallbackObservable.prototype._subscribe = function (subscriber) {\n        var callbackFunc = this.callbackFunc;\n        var args = this.args;\n        var scheduler = this.scheduler;\n        var subject = this.subject;\n        if (!scheduler) {\n            if (!subject) {\n                subject = this.subject = new AsyncSubject_1.AsyncSubject();\n                var handler = function handlerFn() {\n                    var innerArgs = [];\n                    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n                        innerArgs[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n                    }\n                    var source = handlerFn.source;\n                    var selector = source.selector, subject = source.subject;\n                    var err = innerArgs.shift();\n                    if (err) {\n                        subject.error(err);\n                    }\n                    else if (selector) {\n                        var result_1 = tryCatch_1.tryCatch(selector).apply(this, innerArgs);\n                        if (result_1 === errorObject_1.errorObject) {\n                            subject.error(errorObject_1.errorObject.e);\n                        }\n                        else {\n                            subject.next(result_1);\n                            subject.complete();\n                        }\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        subject.next(innerArgs.length <= 1 ?

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves.

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n *\n * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n *\n * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n *\n * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject\n * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use\n * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},\n * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},\n * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually\n * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.\n *\n * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,\n * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());\n *\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));\n *\n * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.\n *\n * connectableSeconds.connect();\n *\n * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,\n * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,\n * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds\n *     .multicast(\n *         () => new Subject(),\n *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.\n *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,\n *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.\n *     .subscribe();\n *\n * @see {@link publish}\n * @see {@link publishLast}\n * @see {@link publishBehavior}\n * @see {@link publishReplay}\n * @see {@link share}\n * @see {@link shareReplay}\n *\n * @param {Function|Subject} subjectOrSubjectFactory - Factory function to create an intermediate Subject through\n * which the source sequence's elements will be multicast to the selector function input Observable or\n * ConnectableObservable returned by the operator.\n * @param {Function} [selector] - Optional selector function that can use the input stream\n * as many times as needed, without causing multiple subscriptions to the source stream.\n * Subscribers to the input source will receive all notifications of the source from the\n * time of the subscription forward.\n * @return {Observable<T>|ConnectableObservable<T>} An Observable that emits the results of invoking the selector\n * on the source stream or a special {@link ConnectableObservable}, if selector was not provided.\n *\n * @method multicast\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector) {\n    return multicast_1.multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector)(this);\n}\nexports.multicast = multicast;\n//# sourceMappingURL=multicast.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/operator/multicast.js\n// module id = ./node_modules/rxjs/operator/multicast.js\n// module chunks = 203586849492694","\"use strict\";\nvar observeOn_1 = require('../operators/observeOn');\n/**\n *\n * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>\n *\n * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule\n * notifications emitted by the source Observable.

It behaves exactly the same,\n * still accepting as a first argument either a number or a Date, which control - respectively -\n * when values of source Observable should be emitted or when it should complete.\n *\n * The only difference is that it accepts a second, required parameter. This parameter\n * should be an Observable which will be subscribed when source Observable fails any timeout check.\n * So whenever regular `timeout` would emit an error, `timeoutWith` will instead start re-emitting\n * values from second Observable. Note that this fallback Observable is not checked for timeouts\n * itself, so it can emit values and complete at arbitrary points in time. From the moment of a second\n * subscription, Observable returned from `timeoutWith` simply mirrors fallback stream. When that\n * stream completes, it completes as well.\n *\n * Scheduler, which in case of `timeout` is provided as as second argument, can be still provided\n * here - as a third, optional parameter. It still is used to schedule timeout checks and -\n * as a consequence - when second Observable will be subscribed, since subscription happens\n * immediately after failing check.\n *\n * @example <caption>Add fallback observable</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n * const minutes = Rx.Observable.interval(60 * 1000);\n *\n * seconds.timeoutWith(900, minutes)\n *     .subscribe(\n *         value => console.log(value), // After 900ms, will start emitting `minutes`,\n *                                      // since first value of `seconds` will not arrive fast enough.\n *         err => console.log(err) // Would be called after 900ms in case of `timeout`,\n *                                 // but here will never be called.\n *     );\n *\n * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values\n *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete\n * @param {Observable<T>} withObservable Observable which will be subscribed if source fails timeout check.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] Scheduler controlling when timeout checks occur.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that mirrors behaviour of source or, when timeout check fails, of an Observable\n *                          passed as a second parameter.\n * @method timeoutWith\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction timeoutWith(due, withObservable, scheduler) {\n    if (scheduler === void 0) { scheduler = async_1.async; }\n    return function (source) {\n        var absoluteTimeout = isDate_1.isDate(due);\n        var waitFor = absoluteTimeout ?
